        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You are assigned to a first-response task after a disaster occurred with a robot teammate.</p> 
        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You have access to the floor plan BEFORE the disaster but it may have changed due to damage incurred by the disaster. For example, some paths may be blocked and
             only your robot teammate that is working on the scene can sense these changes. So be aware. </p>
        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> In this scenario, your task is to team up with a remote robot that is working on the disaster scene.
            The team goal is to search all the marked locations AS FAST AS POSSIBLE and your role is to help the robot by providing high-level guidance about what the next marked location to visit.  </p>
        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> To provide your high-level guidance to the robot, click on a room marked 
            with <img src="marked.jpg"> that is unvisited. This informs the robot that is the next room that you think it should visit.  </p>

        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">  Continue ordering robot to move to rooms until all marked locations are visited. </p>
        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> You can change your command  if you think that the robot is not performing the appropriate action.</p>

        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> Below you can see a sample map with a key for tile types. </p>
        <img src="map.jpg" style="display:block;width:1200x;height:360px; margin:auto">

        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> Your team performance will be measured based on how quickly you clear the rooms.
                If you give high level order to the robot, it will move 10% faster than its normal speed. </p>
